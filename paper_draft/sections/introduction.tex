\section{Introduction}

Iterated function systems (IFS) have been extensively studied since their formalization by Hutchinson \cite{hutchinson1981fractals} and have found numerous applications in fractal geometry and dynamical systems. In this paper, we introduce a significant generalization called Iterated Function Networks (IFNs), where the iteration pattern is determined by a directed graph structure rather than simple composition.

The study of IFNs bridges several mathematical areas, including metric geometry, graph theory, and dynamical systems. While classical IFS theory has been extended in various directions \cite{barnsley1988fractals,falconer1997techniques}, the network-based approach we propose offers new insights into the behavior of composed mappings and their limit sets.

Our main contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A formal framework for analyzing IFNs on metric spaces
    \item Convergence theorems with explicit rate bounds
    \item Characterization of attractors under relaxed contractivity conditions
    \item Applications to optimization and fractal generation
\end{itemize}
