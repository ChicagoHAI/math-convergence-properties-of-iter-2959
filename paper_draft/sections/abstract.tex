We introduce and study Iterated Function Networks (IFNs), a novel class of dynamical systems defined on metric spaces. These networks generalize classical iterated function systems by allowing composition patterns determined by directed graphs. We establish fundamental convergence theorems for contractive IFNs, prove the existence of attractors under relaxed conditions, and demonstrate applications to fractal generation and optimization algorithms. Our main results provide explicit bounds on convergence rates and characterize the topological properties of limit sets.
