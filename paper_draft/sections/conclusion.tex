\section{Conclusion}

We have developed the fundamental theory of Iterated Function Networks, establishing their basic convergence properties and dimensional characteristics. Several directions for future research include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Extending results to infinite graphs
    \item Studying random walks on IFNs
    \item Developing algorithms for dimension computation
    \item Applications to neural networks and deep learning
\end{itemize}

The framework of IFNs provides a promising approach to studying complex dynamical systems with network structure.
